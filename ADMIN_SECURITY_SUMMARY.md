## 🛡️ Security Implementation Details

### Admin Class Security (`core/admin.py`)

```python
class AgricultureProgramAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    # Image and featured fields are collapsible with warning
    fieldsets = (
        ('Display Settings', {
            'fields': ('image', 'is_featured'),
            'description': '⚠️ ADMIN ONLY: Only administrators can modify these settings.',
            'classes': ('collapse',)  # Collapsed by default
        }),
    )
    
    def get_readonly_fields(self, request, obj=None):
        """Make image and is_featured read-only for non-superusers"""
        if not request.user.is_superuser:
            return ('image', 'is_featured')
        return ()
    
    def has_delete_permission(self, request, obj=None):
        """Only superusers can delete programs"""
        return request.user.is_superuser
```

### Key Security Features:
1. **Field-Level Permissions**: Image and is_featured fields are read-only for non-superusers
2. **Visual Warning**: Admin-only warning message in Display Settings section
3. **Collapsed Section**: Display Settings collapsed by default for security
4. **Delete Protection**: Only superusers can delete programs
5. **No Public Access**: No public forms or views expose program image upload

## 🔐 How to Grant Admin Privileges

### Create Superuser (Full Admin Access)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Enter username, email, and password
```

### Upgrade Existing User to Superuser
```bash
python manage.py shell
```
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
user = User.objects.get(username='username_here')
user.is_superuser = True
user.is_staff = True
user.save()
print(f"{user.username} is now a superuser")
```

### Via Admin Panel (if you're already a superuser)
1. Go to `/admin/auth/user/`
2. Click on the user
3. Check both:
   - ✅ **Staff status** (allows admin access)
   - ✅ **Superuser status** (allows image management)
4. Save

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Only grant superuser to trusted administrators
- ✅ Use strong passwords for admin accounts
- ✅ Regularly audit superuser accounts
- ✅ Monitor image upload activity
- ✅ Keep Django and dependencies updated
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Enable CSRF protection (already enabled)
- ✅ Regular security audits

### DON'T:
- ❌ Give superuser status to untrusted users
- ❌ Share superuser credentials
- ❌ Allow anonymous image uploads
- ❌ Disable CSRF protection
- ❌ Expose admin panel without HTTPS
- ❌ Use weak passwords
- ❌ Ignore security warnings

---

## 🔍 Verify Security

### Check Who Has Superuser Access:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
superusers = User.objects.filter(is_superuser=True)
for user in superusers:
    print(f"Superuser: {user.username} ({user.email})")
```

### Test Image Upload Permission:
1. Login as staff user (not superuser)
2. Go to `/admin/core/agricultureprogram/`
3. Try to edit a program
4. Verify: Image field shows as **read-only**
5. Verify: Display Settings shows **"⚠️ ADMIN ONLY"** warning

### Run Security Tests:
```bash
python manage.py test core.tests.test_admin_security -v 2
```

## 📝 What Staff Users See

When a staff user (non-superuser) opens a program in admin:

### Display Settings Section:
- **Status**: Collapsed by default
- **Warning**: "⚠️ ADMIN ONLY: Only administrators can modify these settings"
- **Image Field**: Shows current image but **cannot upload/change**
- **Is_featured Field**: Shows current status but **cannot toggle**

### Other Fields:
All other fields remain editable:
- Title ✅
