# Automatic Backup System - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The automatic backup at 5:00 PM was not working because:
1. No scheduling mechanism was configured in the system
2. The backup command existed but had no automated trigger

## Solution Implemented

### For Windows Systems
Since `django-crontab` is not compatible with Windows (requires Unix `fcntl` module), we implemented a Windows-specific solution using Windows Task Scheduler.

### Components Created

1. **`scheduled_backup.py`** - Management command that:
   - Wraps the existing `backup_db` command
   - Adds notification system for admin users
   - Logs all activities to ActivityLog
   - Provides detailed success/failure reporting

2. **`run_backup.bat`** - Windows batch script that:
   - Changes to the project directory
   - Executes the scheduled backup command
   - Logs output to `backup_log.txt`

3. **`setup_backup_schedule.ps1`** - PowerShell script that:
   - Creates a Windows Scheduled Task
   - Sets it to run daily at 5:00 PM
   - Configures proper permissions and settings

4. **`test_backup.py`** - Testing script that:
   - Verifies all backup components are working
   - Tests manual backup execution
   - Checks notification system
   - Validates ActivityLog entries

## Current Status

✅ **FIXED AND OPERATIONAL**

- **Last Test Run**: August 24, 2025 at 2:26 PM - SUCCESS
- **Next Scheduled Run**: August 24, 2025 at 5:00 PM
- **Task Name**: "AgriDjangoPortal Daily Backup"
- **Schedule**: Daily at 5:00 PM (17:00)
- **Retention**: 7 days (old backups auto-deleted)

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Installed required packages (`django-crontab` for Unix compatibility)
2. ✅ Created backup management commands
3. ✅ Set up Windows Task Scheduler
4. ✅ Tested manual backup execution
5. ✅ Verified notification system works
6. ✅ Confirmed ActivityLog entries are created
7. ✅ Validated scheduled task is active

## Features Now Working

1. **Automatic Daily Backups** - Runs at 5:00 PM every day
2. **Admin Notifications** - All staff users receive success/failure notifications
3. **Activity Logging** - Complete audit trail in ActivityLog
4. **Backup Rotation** - Automatic cleanup of backups older than 7 days
5. **Manual Backup Option** - Available through admin panel
6. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error reporting and logging

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/core/management/commands/scheduled_backup.py`
- `/run_backup.bat`
- `/setup_backup_schedule.ps1`
- `/test_backup.py`
- `/BACKUP_SETUP.md`
- `/backup_log.txt` (generated)

### Modified Files:
- `/requirements.txt` - Added `django-crontab>=0.7.1`
- `/agrostudies_project/settings.py` - Added CRONJOBS configuration
- `/render.yaml` - Added cron setup for production

## Backup Files Location
- **Directory**: `C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\AgriDjangoPortal\AgriDjangoPortal\backups\`
- **Format**: `db-sqlite-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sqlite3`
- **Current Backups**:
  - db-sqlite-20250819-233210.sqlite3
  - db-sqlite-20250822-025103.sqlite3
  - db-sqlite-20250824-142410.sqlite3
  - db-sqlite-20250824-142623.sqlite3

## How to Monitor

1. **Check Task Status**:
   ```powershell
   Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'AgriDjangoPortal Daily Backup'
   ```

2. **View Backup Log**:
   ```cmd
   type backup_log.txt
   ```

3. **Check Admin Panel**:
   - Navigate to Admin → Activity Logs
   - Look for entries with model_name='core.Database'

4. **Check Notifications**:
   - Admin users will see backup status in notification dropdown

## Manual Operations

- **Run Backup Now**:
  ```powershell
  Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'AgriDjangoPortal Daily Backup'
  ```
  Or:
  ```cmd
  python manage.py scheduled_backup
  ```

- **Disable Automatic Backup**:
  ```powershell
  Disable-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'AgriDjangoPortal Daily Backup'
  ```

- **Re-enable Automatic Backup**:
  ```powershell
  Enable-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'AgriDjangoPortal Daily Backup'
  ```

## Production Deployment Note

For production on Render.com or other cloud platforms:
1. Use the platform's native cron job feature
2. Schedule command: `python manage.py scheduled_backup`
3. Schedule: `0 17 * * *` (5:00 PM daily)

## Conclusion

The automatic backup system is now fully functional and will run daily at 5:00 PM. The system includes comprehensive logging, notifications, and error handling to ensure reliable database backups.
