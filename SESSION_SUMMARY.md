### 3. ✅ Admin Security - Image Upload Restrictions

#### What Was Secured:
- **Image Upload**: Only administrators (superusers) can upload farm images

#### Security Implementation:
- `get_readonly_fields()` method: Makes image/featured read-only for staff
- `has_delete_permission()` override: Only superusers can delete
- Visual warning: "⚠️ ADMIN ONLY" message in admin
- Collapsed Display Settings: Security through obscurity layer

#### Permission Matrix:
| User Type | Admin Access | Edit Programs | Upload Images | Delete Programs |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Regular User | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Staff User | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Superuser | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `core/admin.py` - Enhanced security permissions
- `core/tests/test_admin_security.py` - 13 security tests (NEW)
